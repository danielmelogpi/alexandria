### Supporting multiple API versions
https://www.terlici.com/2014/09/23/multiple-api-version.html

> Should I really make that change?

> Shoud I have different paths for different API versions?

> Can I keep the same paths and still support multiple versions?

> Is there a way that even clients using an old version can benefit from some of the improvements?

> How should I structure my code and folders?

> Where should I put different API versions?

> If I use different paths for different versions should I change every path?

> What if my current large app has no support for multiple API versions?

> How should I handle legacy code? When can I remove it safely?

> What if there is a client who never updates?
